The deep fake detection system has shown promising results, but there
are several areas for future improvement. One area is the exploration
of more advanced data augmentation techniques to further enhance
the model's performance. Techniques such as mixup augmentation,
CutMix, and RandAugment could be explored to generate more diverse
training samples and improve the model's ability to generalize to
unseen data.
